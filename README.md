## Background
Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning have made it possible to predict judgments based on the textual facts of the case (provide citation). This has huge implications in their ability to aid and assist, both judges and litigants, in decision making. The technology can automate some of the manual work judges need to do, and in some cases may also have the potential to completely remove human intervention. It could also benefit the litigants by making them more informed about the likely outcome of the process. Discernible patterns of behaviour by litigants, lawyers and judges can also be extracted for informing policy questions.

## Analytical Problem

The analytical problem can be broken down in to two parts:
1.	Use text of the case-facts to predict the outcome of the case / the judgment. For instance, is the case likely to be disposed in favour the plaintiff or the defendant. In simple cases, this translates into a binary classification problem
2.	What are the discernible patterns of behaviour by litigants, lawyers, judges and nature of the cases that can inform policy question (this aspect of the problem will be further refined)

## Project Outcome

The spirit of this project is academic research. As such, the desired outcome is either a whitepaper or a research paper in a reputed journal.
